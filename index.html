        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi there! I'm a spirited student at Santa Fe High School, eagerly awaiting my graduation in May 2025. My love for technology drives me, and I can't wait to dive into Information Technology and Computer Science at the University of Oklahoma.</p>
        
        <p>Currently, I’m the Operations Manager at Mocha House in Edmond, OK. I oversee daily operations, manage a fantastic team, and ensure everything runs smoothly. I’m proud to say I’ve boosted sales by 20% and reduced costs by 34% during my tenure!</p>
        
        <p>Before Mocha House, I was a Shift Lead at Rice n Buns. Managing a team of 11 was challenging but incredibly rewarding. I thrived on delivering top-notch customer service and optimizing operations.</p>
        
        <p>Academically, I've been a state finalist in the Oklahoma DECA Marketing and Entrepreneurship competitions. I enjoy applying marketing principles and entrepreneurial skills in real-world scenarios. Plus, I'm proficient in English and Arabic, and I have a good grasp of Spanish!</p>
        
        <p>When I’m not working or studying, you’ll find me exploring new technologies, reading about computer science innovations, playing basketball, or traveling to new places. I’m all about learning and experiencing new things!</p>
